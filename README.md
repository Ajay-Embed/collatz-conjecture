## The unsolvable problem - Collatz Conjecture :

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows:

Start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:

- If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
- If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
- The conjecture is that, no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1 & then loop
  between 4 2 and 1 forever.

For a very detailed introduction to the conjecture please take a look at this video by Veritasium -
